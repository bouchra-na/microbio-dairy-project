# Microbiological Analysis of Dairy Products

---

### 📘 Project Description
This project aims to evaluate the microbiological and basic physicochemical quality of selected dairy products (example: pasteurized milk), identify critical contamination points, and propose practical recommendations to improve food safety.

### 🎯 Objectives
1. Determine Total Viable Count (TVC) of selected dairy samples (CFU/mL or CFU/g).  
2. Detect indicator organisms (Total Coliforms, E. coli).  
3. Measure basic physicochemical parameters (pH; optional: fat, moisture).  
4. Compare results with recommended microbiological criteria and propose corrective actions.

---

### ⚙️ Methodology
1. Sampling plan (5–10 samples from different sources/dates).  
2. Sample preparation and serial dilutions following ISO 6887 guidelines.  
3. Microbiological analyses: Standard Plate Count (TVC), Coliform count, etc.  
4. Incubation and colony counting; data recording in CSV files.  
5. Data analysis and interpretation; final report & recommendations.

### 🧭 Work Plan & Kanban
We use GitHub Projects to track tasks:
- **To do**: literature review, sampling, protocol writing.  
- **In progress**: laboratory analyses, data entry.  
- **Done**: data analysis, report writing, final submission.
